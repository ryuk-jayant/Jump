<h1>Jump To Work</h1>

- We usually work with 2 to 3 directories in general, and navigating to them in terminal is such a pain. To save us some "cd"s, I have written a script that lets you bookmark your locations with a **name** and then jumps to that location using that **name**.


- <h3>Installation</h3>
  1)just clone the repo and copy sh files to bin directory on your machine.
  
  2)Alter the shell script and replace the **username** "JKJ-ryuk" with your own username.
  
  3)and done
  
- <h3>How to use?</h3>
   1) Go to the directory you want to bookmark.
   2) Run **Save.sh "Bookmark_name"**.
   3) Now you can jump to this directory from anywhere using **go.sh "Bookmark_name"**.

 Do help me make it more user friendly and purposeful
